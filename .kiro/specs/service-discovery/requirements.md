# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Service Discovery is a critical feature that enables services to automatically find and connect to other services in a distributed system. This feature will extend the existing service management system to support dynamic service registration, discovery, and health monitoring. The service discovery system will provide a centralized registry where services can register themselves and discover other services without hardcoded configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a service developer, I want services to automatically register themselves with a discovery service, so that other services can find them without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service starts THEN the system SHALL automatically register the service with the discovery registry
2. WHEN a service registers THEN the system SHALL include service metadata (name, address, port, health endpoint, tags)
3. WHEN a service shuts down THEN the system SHALL automatically deregister the service from the registry
4. IF service registration fails THEN the system SHALL retry registration with exponential backoff
5. WHEN a service is registered THEN the system SHALL assign a unique service instance ID

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a service developer, I want to discover available services by name or tags, so that I can connect to them dynamically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service queries for another service by name THEN the system SHALL return all healthy instances of that service
2. WHEN a service queries with tags THEN the system SHALL return services matching those tags
3. WHEN no services match the query THEN the system SHALL return an empty result without error
4. WHEN multiple instances exist THEN the system SHALL support load balancing strategies (round-robin, random, least-connections)
5. WHEN service discovery fails THEN the system SHALL return cached results if available

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want services to be monitored for health, so that unhealthy services are automatically removed from discovery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service registers THEN the system SHALL periodically check the service health endpoint
2. WHEN a health check fails THEN the system SHALL mark the service as unhealthy after configurable consecutive failures
3. WHEN a service is unhealthy THEN the system SHALL exclude it from discovery results
4. WHEN an unhealthy service recovers THEN the system SHALL automatically mark it as healthy and include it in discovery
5. WHEN a service doesn't respond to health checks THEN the system SHALL remove it from the registry after a timeout

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a service developer, I want to receive notifications when services I depend on change, so that I can update my connections accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service subscribes to watch another service THEN the system SHALL notify on service registration/deregistration
2. WHEN a service's health status changes THEN the system SHALL notify all watchers
3. WHEN a service's metadata changes THEN the system SHALL notify all watchers
4. WHEN notifications fail to deliver THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN a watcher becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL remove the watch subscription

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want service discovery to work across multiple environments, so that services can discover each other in development, staging, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services register THEN the system SHALL support environment-based service isolation
2. WHEN querying services THEN the system SHALL only return services from the same environment by default
3. WHEN cross-environment discovery is needed THEN the system SHALL support explicit environment specification
4. WHEN environment configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL use a default environment
5. WHEN services move between environments THEN the system SHALL handle registration updates correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a service developer, I want service discovery to be resilient to network failures, so that temporary outages don't break service communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the discovery service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use cached service information
2. WHEN network partitions occur THEN the system SHALL continue operating with last known service state
3. WHEN the discovery service recovers THEN the system SHALL synchronize with the latest service state
4. WHEN cache expires THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh from the discovery service
5. WHEN all discovery attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation with error reporting
